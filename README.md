# Kinesis Advantage2 Configuration Files
The keyboard should have the latest Scandinavian firmware, available at https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/advantage2-non-us-versions/#firmware-updates.

To install the configs open the v-Drive by pressing (progm + F1), copy them into the `active` directory in the v-drive:

```sh
cp qwerty.txt state.txt /Volumes/ADVANTAGE2/active
```

and finally close the v-Drive by pressing (progm + F1).

NB: qwerty.txt and state.txt uses CRLF newlines.

This configuration optimizes for a shortcut-heavy MacOS workflow while being similar enough to the default MacOS layout such that it is easy to switch to a laptop keyboard.
