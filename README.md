# Kinesis Advantage2 Configuration Files
The keyboard should have the latest Scandinavian firmware, available at https://kinesis-ergo.com/support/advantage2-non-us-versions/#firmware-updates.

To install the configs copy them into the `active` directory in the v-drive.

```sh
cp qwerty.txt state.txt $VDRIVE/active/
```

NB: qwerty.txt and state.txt uses CRLF newlines.
