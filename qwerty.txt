* I bind the two coluns of keys that i don't really use to the f13-f16 keys so that it's easy to bind them to other actions. Since f13-f16 is not on most keyboards, they are rarely used by applications so i have them free to bind to whatever i want:
[lalt]>[f13]
[home]>[f14]
[end]>[f15]
[rwin]>[f16]
[pup]>[f17]
[pdown]>[f18]
